My name is Ian Weng Chan, but I am more commonly known as Sophia. (see *Fun Fact* below)

I am an incoming PhD candidate in actuarial science at the University of Toronto.
Prior to my current studies, I received my Honours Bachelor of Science in Actuarial Science and my [Masters in Financial Insurance (MFI)](https://mfi.utoronto.ca/)
both from U of T. See my [profile](https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/profile/sophia-chan/) on the School of Graduate Studies community as a MFI representative.

In terms of professional development, having passed six [Society of Actuaries (SOA)](https://www.soa.org/Canada) exams and completed all VEE requirements,
I am committed to acquiring my ASA accreditation, followed by the FSA.

*Fun Fact:* I am both born and self-recognised as female, despite my seemingly masculine name. In fact, my first name is "Ian Weng" together, so I am not Ian as you might have assumed. "Ian Weng" is actually the pronunciation in Portuguese of my Chinese name in Cantonese (take your time to digest this).  So if you are an English speaker and would like to pronounce my name right, you may try the better English "translation" "Yan Wing" instead.
