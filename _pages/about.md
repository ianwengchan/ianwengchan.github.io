My name is Ian Weng Chan, but I am more commonly known as Sophia. (see ***Fun Fact*** below)

I am a PhD candidate in actuarial science at the University of Toronto, supervised by
Prof. [Sheldon Lin](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/sheldon-lin) and 
Prof. [Andrei Badescu](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/andrei-badescu). I am also a member of the [University of Toronto Actuarial Science Research Group](https://actsci.utstat.utoronto.ca/).

Prior to my current studies, I received my Honours Bachelor of Science in Actuarial Science and my [Masters in Financial Insurance (MFI)](https://mfi.utoronto.ca/)
both from U of T. See my [profile](https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/profile/sophia-chan/) on the School of Graduate Studies community,
sharing my thoughts and experience in the MFI program.

In terms of professional development, I am an ASA of the [Society of Actuaries (SOA)](https://www.soa.org), and am committed to acquiring my FSA accreditation.

***Fun Fact:*** I am both born and self-recognised as female, despite my seemingly masculine name. In fact, my first name is "Ian Weng" together, so I am not the Ian you might 
have assumed. "Ian Weng" is actually the pronunciation in Portuguese of my Chinese name in Cantonese (okay I know this is complicated).  If you are an English speaker and would like to pronounce my name right, you may try the better English "translation" "Yan Wing" instead.
