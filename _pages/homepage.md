Here you will find my information and research work.

I am a PhD candidate in actuarial science at the [Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Toronto](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/).
My research focuses on risk modelling, particularly in the context of general insurance.  Recently I have been exploring usage-based insurance and enhancement of auto-insurance ratemaking via incorporation of vehicle telematics data.
I am interested in building insurance models that are data-driven, statistically sound, and more importantly interpretable.
