Here you will find my information and research work.

I am an Assistant Professor of actuarial science at [Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/business).  My research focuses on risk modelling, particularly in the context of general insurance. I have worked extensively on usage-based insurance and the enhancement of auto-insurance ratemaking through the incorporation of vehicle telematics data. More recently, I have started exploring emerging areas in actuarial science, such as cyber risk and behavioural data. I am interested in building insurance models that are data-driven, statistically sound, and more importantly interpretable.
